**Abstract**
I like wine. I like wine data. I don't understand wine reviews.

What makes a wine good or bad, according to the professionals? We’re going to take 130 thousand wine reviews and train a fancy model to find out. We’ll use Locally Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to describe how the model treats individual reviews, complete with a Shiny interface. Is it a good thing for wine to have the “aromas of tennis ball and chalk”? Should you bring that bottle to a dinner party if it tastes like “a pot of stewed prunes”? Let’s find out!
